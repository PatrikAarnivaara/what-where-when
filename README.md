# What Where When

Application for classifying and storing images.

## General info
An application where a user can upload an image and get three classification options from TensorFlowâ€™s image classification model. The uploaded image, the user classification, selected classification, probability, date and GPS coordinates are saved in a MongoDB Atlas document. Uploaded images are saved to Cloudinary. The interface is built with Material-ui and a user can switch between dark and light mode, find uploaded images by clicking the image icon where a detailed view with location of was upload can be seen on a map. The user can also edit their own classification. The location icon in the left-hand corner shows if the user shares his or her geolocation, if that is the case it will be saved to the database when uploading an image.
