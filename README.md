# What Where When

Application for classifying and storing images.

## General info
An application where users can upload an image and get three classification options from TensorFlowâ€™s image classification model. The user can also edit their own classifications. The interface is built with Material-UI. Users can browse uploaded images by clicking the image icon which displays a grid of images. When a user clicks on an image a detailed view is shown to the right side of the grid. The location icon in the left-hand corner shows if the user shares his or her geolocation, if that is the case it will be saved to the database when uploading an image.
